# Chapter 8: Overview of the Verb System

Before diving into individual tenses, this chapter provides a map of the Venetian verb system: the conjugation classes, how stems and endings work, and how Venetian verbs compare to Italian ones. Understanding this framework makes the details in subsequent chapters easier to absorb.

## 8.1 The Three Conjugations

Like Italian, Venetian verbs divide into three conjugation classes based on the infinitive ending:

| Conjugation | Infinitive Ending | Example | Italian Equivalent |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|-------------------|
| First | **-ar** | *parlar* (to speak) | *parlare* |
| Second | **-er** | *témer* (to fear) | *temere* |
| Third | **-ir** | *partir* (to leave) | *partire* |

### First Conjugation (-ar)

The largest class. Most Venetian verbs belong here, including:

| Venetian | Italian | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *parlar* | *parlare* | to speak |
| *magnar* | *mangiare* | to eat |
| *laorar* | *lavorare* | to work |
| *portar* | *portare* | to carry |
| *scoltar* | *ascoltare* | to listen |
| *trovar* | *trovare* | to find |
| *comprar* | *comprare* | to buy |
| *tornar* | *tornare* | to return |

### Second Conjugation (-er)

A smaller class, including:

| Venetian | Italian | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *témer* | *temere* | to fear |
| *béver* | *bere* | to drink |
| *mòver* | *muovere* | to move |
| *véder* | *vedere* | to see |
| *saver* | *sapere* | to know |
| *poder* | *potere* | to be able |
| *voler* | *volere* | to want |

Note: Some verbs that are -ere in Italian become -ar in Venetian (e.g., Italian *avere* → Venetian *aver* or *gaver*).

### Third Conjugation (-ir)

Including:

| Venetian | Italian | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *partir* | *partire* | to leave |
| *dormir* | *dormire* | to sleep |
| *sentir* | *sentire* | to hear/feel |
| *finir* | *finire* | to finish |
| *capir* | *capire* | to understand |
| *vegnir* | *venire* | to come |

Many -ir verbs take an infix **-is-** in certain forms (like Italian *finire* → *finisco*). This pattern is covered in Chapter 9.

## 8.2 Verb Stems and Endings

Venetian verbs consist of a **stem** plus **endings** that indicate person, number, tense, and mood.

### Finding the Stem

For regular verbs, remove the infinitive ending to get the stem:

| Infinitive | Stem |
|------------|------|
| *parl-ar* | *parl-* |
| *tem-er* | *tem-* |
| *part-ir* | *part-* |

### The Ending Does Less Work

A crucial difference from Italian: Venetian verb endings often don't distinguish person as clearly as Italian ones do. Compare:

**Italian *parlare* (present):**






| Person | Form | Ending is unique? |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| io | *parlo* | yes |
| tu | *parli* | yes |
| lui/lei | *parla* | yes |
| noi | *parliamo* | yes |
| voi | *parlate* | yes |
| loro | *parlano* | yes |

**Venetian *parlar* (present):**







| Person | Form | Ending is unique? |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| mi | *parlo* | yes |
| ti | *te parli* | same as 3sg in some dialects |
| lu/ela | *el/la parla* | same as 2sg in some dialects |
| nu | *parlemo* | yes |
| vu | *parlè* | yes |
| lori/lore | *i/le parla* | same as 3sg |

Notice that 2sg, 3sg, and 3pl can have identical or very similar verb forms. This is why **subject clitics are obligatory** - they do the work of distinguishing person that the endings don't do.

## 8.3 The Clitic Partnership

This is the key insight for Venetian verbs: **clitics and endings work together**.

| Person | Clitic | Verb form | Together |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| 1sg | (none) | *parlo* | *Parlo.* |
| 2sg | *te* | *parli* | *Te parli.* |
| 3sg m. | *el* | *parla* | *El parla.* |
| 3sg f. | *la* | *parla* | *La parla.* |
| 1pl | (none) | *parlemo* | *Parlemo.* |
| 2pl | (none)* | *parlè* | *Parlè.* |
| 3pl m. | *i* | *parla* | *I parla.* |
| 3pl f. | *le* | *parla* | *Le parla.* |

*The 2pl clitic*ve* exists in some areas but is often omitted.


The clitic tells you **who**; the ending tells you **what tense/mood**. Neither is complete without the other.

## 8.4 Vowel Alternations

Venetian has a systematic vowel alternation in verb stems. Stressed closed vowels (**ó**, **é**) become open/different when unstressed:

| Stressed (1sg, 3sg, 3pl) | Unstressed (2sg, 1pl, 2pl) |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| ó → u | *móvo* → *te muvi* |
| é → i | *bévo* → *te bivi* |

This pattern appears throughout the conjugation system:

| Infinitive | 1sg (stressed) | 2sg (unstressed) |
|------------|----------------|------------------|
| *mòver* | *móvo* | *te muvi* |
| *béver* | *bévo* | *te bivi* |
| *véder* | *védo* | *te vidi* |

Not all verbs show this alternation - it depends on whether the stem vowel is a closed mid vowel. First conjugation verbs with *a* in the stem don't alternate.

## 8.5 Comparison with Italian

### Simpler in Some Ways

- **No double consonants**: Italian *abbiamo* → Venetian *gavemo*
- **Fewer distinct endings**: Person often marked by clitic, not ending
- **More regular patterns**: Some Italian irregulars are regular in Venetian

### More Complex in Others

- **Obligatory clitics**: Must learn clitic + verb combinations
- **Vowel alternations**: Stem changes based on stress
- **Regional variation**: Endings vary across the Veneto

### Verb-by-Verb Differences

Some verbs have different stems or patterns:

| Italian | Venetian | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| *avere* | *aver* / *gaver* | Both forms used |
| *essere* | *èsser* | Different conjugation |
| *andare* | *andar* | Similar but some forms differ |
| *fare* | *far* | Similar |
| *dire* | *dir* | Similar |
| *venire* | *vegnir* | Note the -gn- |
| *tenere* | *tegner* | Note the -gn- |
| *prendere* | *tòr* / *ciòr* | Completely different root |

## 8.6 Tense and Mood Overview

Venetian has essentially the same tense-mood system as Italian:

### Indicative Mood (Statements of Fact)

| Tense | Function | Chapter |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Present | Current actions, general truths | 9 |
| Imperfect | Past habitual/ongoing actions | 12 |
| Passato Prossimo | Completed past actions | 12 |
| Future | Future actions | 13 |

### Subjunctive Mood (Doubt, Desire, Uncertainty)

| Tense | Function | Chapter |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Present subjunctive | Current doubt/desire | 14 |
| Imperfect subjunctive | Past doubt/hypotheticals | 14 |

### Conditional Mood

| Tense | Function | Chapter |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Present conditional | Would/could | 13 |

### Other Forms

| Form | Function | Chapter |
|------|----------|---------|
| Imperative | Commands | 15 |
| Infinitive | Base form, after prepositions | 16 |
| Gerund | Ongoing action | 16 |
| Past participle | Compound tenses, adjectives | 16 |

## 8.7 The Progressive Construction

One feature Venetian shares with other northern Italian languages is a distinctive progressive construction using *èsser drio* (to be behind):

| Venetian | Italian | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *El xe drio magnar.* | *Sta mangiando.* | He is eating. |
| *Te si drio laorar?* | *Stai lavorando?* | Are you working? |
| *I xe drio rivar.* | *Stanno arrivando.* | They are arriving. |

Literally "he is behind to eat" - the idea being that one is "in the middle of" or "in the process of" an action. This construction is very common in spoken Venetian.

## 8.8 Learning Strategy

Given the clitic-verb partnership, the best approach is:

1. **Learn complete phrases**, not isolated verb forms: *Te parli* not just *parli*
2. **Practice with clitics from the start**: Don't learn verb endings separately
3. **Listen for patterns**: The clitic often tells you more than the ending
4. **Accept variation**: Different areas have slightly different forms - focus on one variety first

## Summary

Key points about the Venetian verb system:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Three conjugations | -ar, -er, -ir (like Italian) |
| Clitic partnership | Clitics + endings together mark person |
| Vowel alternation | Closed → open vowels in unstressed positions |
| Regional variation | Endings vary; clitics are universal |
| Progressive | *èsser drio* + infinitive |

The next chapter puts this framework into practice with the present indicative - the most essential tense for basic communication.
