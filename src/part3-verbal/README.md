# Part III: Verbal Morphology

Verbs are the engine of any sentence. In Venetian, verbs carry information about who is acting, when, and how - but they work in partnership with the subject clitics introduced in Chapter 7. You cannot fully understand Venetian verbs without understanding how they interact with *te*, *el*, *la*, *i*, *le*.

This section covers the Venetian verb system systematically:

**Chapter 8: Overview of the Verb System** introduces the three conjugation classes (-ar, -er, -ir), the concept of verb stems, and how Venetian verbs compare to Italian. It provides the framework for the chapters that follow.

**Chapter 9: Present Indicative** covers the most essential tense - how to say what is happening now. This chapter details regular conjugations for all three classes and introduces the crucial interaction between verb endings and subject clitics.

**Chapter 10: Auxiliaries** focuses on the two most important verbs: *èsser* (to be) and *gavér/aver* (to have). These are used constantly on their own and are essential for forming compound tenses.

**Chapter 11: Common Irregular Verbs** covers high-frequency verbs that don't follow regular patterns: *andar* (to go), *far* (to do/make), *dir* (to say), *star* (to stay), *véder* (to see), and others.

**Chapter 12: Past Tenses** explains how to talk about the past, including the compound past (*passato prossimo*) and the imperfect (*imperfetto*).

**Chapter 13: Future and Conditional** covers talking about what will happen and what would happen.

**Chapter 14: Subjunctive** introduces the mood of doubt, desire, and uncertainty.

**Chapter 15: Imperative** explains commands and requests.

**Chapter 16: Non-Finite Forms** covers infinitives, participles, and gerunds.

A note on approach: Venetian verb morphology is simpler than Italian in some ways (fewer distinct endings) but more complex in others (the obligatory clitic system). The key insight is that **clitics and verb endings work together** to mark person and number. In some forms, the clitic does most of the work; in others, the ending does. Understanding this partnership is essential.
