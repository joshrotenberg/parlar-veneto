# Chapter 7: Pronouns

The pronoun system is where Venetian diverges most dramatically from Italian. While subject pronouns and object pronouns are similar in form, Venetian has a distinctive system of **obligatory subject clitics** that have no equivalent in standard Italian. These small, unstressed pronouns appear before the verb in most sentences and are essential to sounding natural in Venetian.

## 7.1 Subject Pronouns

### Emphatic (Strong) Subject Pronouns

These are the stressed, independent pronouns used for emphasis or contrast:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | *mi* | *nu* / *noaltri* |
| 2nd | *ti* | *vu* / *voaltri* |
| 3rd m. | *lu* / *eło* | *lori* / *eli* |
| 3rd f. | *ea* / *eła* | *lore* / *ełe* |

**Comparison with Italian:**

| Venetian | Italian | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *mi* | *io* | I |
| *ti* | *tu* | you (sg.) |
| *lu/eło* | *lui* | he |
| *ea/eła* | *lei* | she |
| *nu/noaltri* | *noi* | we |
| *vu/voaltri* | *voi* | you (pl.) |
| *lori/eli* | *loro* | they (m.) |
| *lore/ełe* | *loro* | they (f.) |

### When to Use Emphatic Pronouns

Emphatic pronouns are **optional** and used for:

**Emphasis or contrast:**
- ***Mi** no go fato gnente!* (I didn't do anything! - emphasizing "I")
- *Ti te lo feto ti, **mi** no.* (You do it, not me.)

**After prepositions:**
- *Vien con **mi**.* (Come with me.)
- *Xe par **ti**.* (It's for you.)

**In isolation:**
- *Chi xe stà? **Mi**.* (Who was it? Me.)

## 7.2 The Clitic System

This is the heart of Venetian grammar. Subject clitics are small, unstressed pronouns that **must** appear before the verb in 2nd person and 3rd person. This is not optional - omitting them sounds wrong to native speakers.

### The Subject Clitics

| Person | Clitic | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| 1st sg. | (none) | No clitic needed |
| 2nd sg. | *te* | *ti* in Venice |
| 3rd sg. m. | *el* | *al* in Bellunese |
| 3rd sg. f. | *la* / *ła* | |
| 1st pl. | (none) | No clitic needed |
| 2nd pl. | (*ve*) | Regional, often absent |
| 3rd pl. m. | *i* | |
| 3rd pl. f. | *le* / *łe* | |

### How Clitics Work

In Venetian, you say:

| Venetian | Literal | Natural English |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| *Mi magno.* | I eat. | I eat. |
| *Ti **te** magni.* | You you-eat. | You eat. |
| *Lu **el** magna.* | He he-eats. | He eats. |
| *Ea **la** magna.* | She she-eats. | She eats. |
| *Nu magnemo.* | We eat. | We eat. |
| *Vu magnè.* | You(pl) eat. | You(pl) eat. |
| *Lori **i** magna.* | They(m) they-eat. | They eat. |
| *Lore **le** magna.* | They(f) they-eat. | They eat. |

Notice:
- 1st person (singular and plural) has **no clitic**
- 2nd and 3rd person **require** the clitic
- The emphatic pronoun (*ti*, *lu*, *ea*, etc.) is optional, but the clitic is not

### Why Clitics Exist

In Venetian, verb endings for 2nd and 3rd person are often identical:

- *magni* (you eat) vs. *magna* (he/she eats) - different, but...
- *magnavi* (you were eating) vs. *magnava* (he/she was eating) - same in some dialects

The clitic disambiguates. It tells you who's doing the action even when the verb ending doesn't.

### Clitics in Questions

In questions, the clitic comes **after** the verb (inversion):

| Statement | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| *Ti **te** magni.* | ***Magni**-**to**?* (Do you eat?) |
| *Lu **el** magna.* | ***Magna**-**lo**?* (Does he eat?) |
| *Ea **la** vien.* | ***Vien**-**la**?* (Is she coming?) |
| *Lori **i** parte.* | ***Parte**-**li**?* (Are they leaving?) |

Note the clitic changes slightly in inversion: *te* → *to*, *el* → *lo*, etc.

**With question words:**

- *Cossa **te** feto?* (What are you doing?)
- *Dove **el** va?* (Where is he going?)
- *Quando **i** riva?* (When are they arriving?)

### Clitics with Compound Tenses

With auxiliary verbs (*aver*, *èsser*), the clitic attaches to the auxiliary:

- *Ti **te** ga magnà.* (You have eaten.)
- *Lu **el** xe ndà.* (He has gone.)
- *Lore **le** ga parlà.* (They [f.] have spoken.)

### Clitics in Negative Sentences

The clitic comes between *no* and the verb:

- *Ti **no te** magni.* (You don't eat.)
- *Lu **no el** va.* (He doesn't go.)
- *Lori **no i** capisse.* (They don't understand.)

### Impersonal Constructions

When the subject is postverbal (after the verb), as with unaccusative verbs announcing news or new information, the clitic is dropped:

**Normal (clitic present):**
- *Mé soreła **la** xe rivà.* ([As for] my sister, she has arrived.)

**Impersonal/news announcement (no clitic):**
- *Xe rivà mé soreła.* (My sister has arrived! - news)

In the impersonal form, the past participle stays masculine singular regardless of the subject:
- *Xe rivà mé soreła.* (not *rivàe*, even though *soreła* is feminine)

### Regional Variation in Clitics

| Region | 2sg clitic | 3sg m. clitic |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Venice | *ti* | *el* |
| Padua-Vicenza-Rovigo-Verona | *te* | *el* |
| Treviso-Belluno | *te/tu* | *el/al* |

Despite these variations, speakers across the Veneto understand each other because the clitic system itself is universal.

## 7.3 Object Pronouns

### Direct Object Pronouns

| Person | Pronoun | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 1st sg. | *me* | *El **me** vede.* (He sees me.) |
| 2nd sg. | *te* | *Ghe **te** ciamo.* (I'll call you.) |
| 3rd sg. m. | *lo* | *Go **lo** visto.* (I saw him/it.) |
| 3rd sg. f. | *la* | *Go **la** vista.* (I saw her/it.) |
| 1st pl. | *ne* | *El **ne** conosse.* (He knows us.) |
| 2nd pl. | *ve* | *Go **ve** ciamà.* (I called you.) |
| 3rd pl. m. | *li* | *Go **li** visti.* (I saw them.) |
| 3rd pl. f. | *le* | *Go **le** viste.* (I saw them.) |

### Indirect Object Pronouns

| Person | Pronoun | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 1st sg. | *me* | *El **me** ga dito.* (He told me.) |
| 2nd sg. | *te* | *Te **te** digo doman.* (I'll tell you tomorrow.) |
| 3rd sg. | *ghe* | ***Ghe** digo.* (I tell him/her.) |
| 1st pl. | *ne* | *El **ne** ga scrito.* (He wrote to us.) |
| 2nd pl. | *ve* | ***Ve** mando doman.* (I'll send [it] to you tomorrow.) |
| 3rd pl. | *ghe* | ***Ghe** parlo.* (I speak to them.) |

Note: *ghe* is used for all 3rd person indirect objects (him, her, them), unlike Italian which distinguishes *gli* (to him) from *le* (to her) and *loro* (to them).

### The Particle *ghe*

*Ghe* is extremely common in Venetian, functioning as:

**Indirect object (to him/her/them):**
- *Ghe digo.* (I tell him/her/them.)

**Locative (there):**
- *Ghe vado doman.* (I'm going there tomorrow.)
- *No ghe xe gnente.* (There's nothing there.)

**In idiomatic expressions:**
- *Ghe xe...* (There is/are...)
- *No ghe xe problema.* (No problem.)
- *Cossa ghe xe?* (What's the matter? / What's there?)

### Combined Pronouns

When both indirect and direct objects are pronouns, they combine:

| Indirect + Direct | Combined | Example |
|-------------------|----------|---------|
| *me* + *lo* | *me lo* | *El **me lo** ga dà.* (He gave it to me.) |
| *te* + *lo* | *te lo* | ***Te lo** digo.* (I tell it to you.) |
| *ghe* + *lo* | *ghe lo* | ***Ghe lo** mando.* (I send it to him.) |
| *ghe* + *la* | *ghe la* | ***Ghe la** porto.* (I bring it [f.] to him.) |
| *ghe* + *li* | *ghe li* | ***Ghe li** dago.* (I give them to him.) |
| *ghe* + *le* | *ghe le* | ***Ghe le** go date.* (I gave them [f.] to him.) |

## 7.4 Reflexive Pronouns

Reflexive pronouns indicate the action reflects back on the subject:

| Person | Pronoun | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 1st sg. | *me* | *Me lavo.* (I wash myself.) |
| 2nd sg. | *te* | *Te te lavi.* (You wash yourself.) |
| 3rd sg. | *se* | *El se lava.* (He washes himself.) |
| 1st pl. | *se* / *ne* | *Se lavemo.* (We wash ourselves.) |
| 2nd pl. | *ve* | *Ve lavè.* (You wash yourselves.) |
| 3rd pl. | *se* | *I se lava.* (They wash themselves.) |

Note: With reflexive verbs, you still need the subject clitic where required:
- ***Te** te lavi.* (You wash yourself.) - *te* (subject clitic) + *te* (reflexive)
- ***El** se lava.* (He washes himself.) - *el* (subject clitic) + *se* (reflexive)

### Common Reflexive Verbs

| Venetian | Italian | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *lavarse* | *lavarsi* | to wash oneself |
| *vestirse* | *vestirsi* | to dress oneself |
| *ciamarse* | *chiamarsi* | to be called |
| *sentarse* | *sedersi* | to sit down |
| *alsarse* | *alzarsi* | to get up |
| *desmentegarse* | *dimenticarsi* | to forget |
| *ricordarse* | *ricordarsi* | to remember |

## 7.5 Possessive Pronouns

Possessive pronouns (standing alone, not modifying a noun) take the definite article:

| Person | Masculine sg. | Feminine sg. | Masculine pl. | Feminine pl. |
|--------|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| mine | *el me* | *la me* | *i me* | *le me* |
| yours (sg.) | *el to* | *la to* | *i to* | *le to* |
| his/hers | *el so* | *la so* | *i so* | *le so* |
| ours | *el nostro* | *la nostra* | *i nostri* | *le nostre* |
| yours (pl.) | *el vostro* | *la vostra* | *i vostri* | *le vostre* |
| theirs | *el so* | *la so* | *i so* | *le so* |

Examples:
- *Sto libro xe **el me**, queło xe **el to**.* (This book is mine, that one is yours.)
- *La casa xe **la so**.* (The house is his/hers.)

## 7.6 Relative Pronouns

### *Che* (that, which, who)

The most common relative pronoun, used for both people and things, subject and object:

- *El toso **che** xe rivà...* (The boy who arrived...)
- *El libro **che** go leto...* (The book that I read...)
- *La dona **che** te ga visto...* (The woman whom you saw...)

### *Che* with Prepositions

Unlike Italian, which uses *cui* after prepositions, Venetian often uses *che* or restructures:

- *El omo **con che** / **che** parlo con...* (The man with whom I speak...)
- *La casa **che** stago in...* (The house in which I live...)
- *El motivo **par che** / **parché**...* (The reason for which...)

Or with *dove* for places:
- *La casa **dove** stago.* (The house where I live.)

### *Chi* (whoever, he who)

- ***Chi** che magna, paga.* (Whoever eats, pays.)
- ***Chi** che tase, aconsente.* (He who is silent, consents.)

### *Qual* / *El qual*

More formal, used like Italian *il quale*:
- *El toso, **el qual** xe rivà ieri...* (The boy, who arrived yesterday...)

## Summary

The crucial points about Venetian pronouns:

1. **Subject clitics are obligatory** in 2nd and 3rd person - this is the defining feature of Venetian grammar

2. **Clitic order:** subject clitic + (negative) + (reflexive/object pronouns) + verb

3. **Question inversion:** the clitic moves after the verb and changes form slightly

4. ***Ghe*** is a workhorse - indirect object, locative, and in many idioms

5. **Emphatic pronouns are optional** - only for emphasis, contrast, or after prepositions
