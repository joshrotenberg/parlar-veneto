# Part II: Nominal Morphology

Nominal morphology covers the "naming" parts of speech: articles, nouns, adjectives, and pronouns. These elements work together to identify and describe the things we talk about.

If you know Italian, much of this will feel familiar. Venetian has the same basic categories: two genders (masculine and feminine), two numbers (singular and plural), definite and indefinite articles that agree with their nouns, adjectives that match in gender and number. The underlying system is shared Romance inheritance.

But the details differ, sometimes subtly, sometimes dramatically. The articles have different forms (*el* not *il*, *i* not *gli*). Plural formation follows its own patterns. And the pronoun system - particularly the clitics - is where Venetian diverges most strikingly from Italian, with obligatory subject clitics that have no Italian equivalent.

This section covers:

**Chapter 4: Articles** introduces the definite and indefinite articles, their forms, and basic usage patterns.

**Chapter 5: Nouns** covers gender, plural formation, and common noun patterns.

**Chapter 6: Adjectives** describes adjective agreement, position, and comparison.

**Chapter 7: Pronouns** is the most substantial chapter, covering subject pronouns, object pronouns, and the distinctive Venetian clitic system that marks nearly every verb form.

The clitic system deserves special attention. In Italian, you can say *Mangio* (I eat) with no pronoun - the verb ending tells you who's eating. In Venetian, you say *Mi magno* or at minimum *Magno* with an understood subject, but second and third person require clitics: *Ti te magni* (you eat), *Lu el magna* (he eats). These little words - *te*, *el*, *la*, *i*, *le* - are the heartbeat of Venetian sentences. Master them, and you sound Venetian. Ignore them, and you sound like an Italian speaker reading Venetian words.
