# Map of the Veneto

## The Veneto Region

The Veneto (*Vèneto* in Venetian) is a region in northeastern Italy, bordered by the Alps to the north, the Adriatic Sea to the east, and the Po River valley to the south. It encompasses seven provinces, each with its own dialectal character.

## The Dialect Areas

### Central Venetian (*Veneto Centrale*)

The varieties spoken in Padova, Vicenza, and Treviso form the heart of what linguists call "central Venetian." These are mutually intelligible and share most grammatical features. This grammar primarily follows central Venetian conventions.

- **Padovano** - Spoken in Padua and its province. The variety with the most speakers and the largest geographic area.
- **Vicentino** - Spoken in Vicenza. Very close to Padovano.
- **Trevigiano** - Spoken in Treviso. Slightly more conservative in some features.

### Venetian Proper (*Veneziano*)

The dialect of Venice itself is the most famous internationally but is spoken by relatively few people. It has some distinctive features:

- Stronger presence of the evanescent *l* (written *ł*)
- Some unique vocabulary related to maritime and lagoon life
- Often what tourists encounter, but not representative of the broader Venetian-speaking territory

### Western Venetian (*Veneto Occidentale*)

- **Veronese** - Spoken in Verona. Shows influence from neighboring Lombard dialects. Notable differences include *somo* for "we are" (vs. central *semo*) and different vowel patterns.

### Northern Venetian (*Veneto Settentrionale*)

- **Bellunese** - Spoken in the mountain province of Belluno. More archaic features, influence from Ladin and Friulian. Least understood by speakers of other varieties.

### Southern Venetian (*Veneto Meridionale*)

- **Polesano** - Spoken in Rovigo province, between the mouths of the Adige and Po rivers. Shows influence from Emilian dialects to the south.

## The Terraferma

Throughout this book, we refer to the *terraferma* ("mainland" or "dry land"). This term, dating from the Venetian Republic, distinguished the mainland territories from Venice and its lagoon. Today it simply means the Veneto outside of Venice itself.

The terraferma is where most Venetian speakers live. The major cities:

- **Padova** (Padua) - University city, Venetian cultural center
- **Treviso** - Prosecco country, well-preserved historic center
- **Vicenza** - Palladio's city, industrial heartland
- **Verona** - Roman arena, Romeo and Juliet, gateway to Lake Garda
- **Belluno** - Mountain capital, Dolomites gateway

## Beyond the Veneto

Venetian-influenced varieties extend beyond the modern regional borders:

- **Trieste** - The Triestine dialect has Venetian roots but heavy Slavic influence
- **Istria and Dalmatia** - Venetian colonial dialects survived for centuries; some speakers remain
- **Chipilo, Mexico** - A village founded by Veneto emigrants in 1882 preserves a form of Trevigiano
- **Brazil, Argentina, Australia** - Diaspora communities maintain varying degrees of Venetian

## How to Read This Map

The boundaries shown are approximate. Dialect boundaries are never clean lines; they are gradients. A speaker from Cittadella (between Padova and Vicenza) may use forms from both areas. A speaker from the Paduan hills may sound different from one in the city.

The key point: when this grammar says "central Venetian," it means the varieties spoken in the shaded core area of Padova-Vicenza-Treviso. When significant variations exist in other areas, we note them.
