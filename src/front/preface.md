# Preface

Venetian is not a dialect of Italian. It is a distinct Romance language with its own grammar, vocabulary, and literary tradition stretching back over a thousand years. During the height of the Venetian Republic, it served as a lingua franca across the Eastern Mediterranean. Today, it remains a living language spoken by millions in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy and by diaspora communities worldwide.

This grammar aims to be practical. It is written for learners who want to understand and eventually speak Venetian, whether to connect with family heritage, engage with Venetian culture, or simply out of linguistic curiosity. It assumes familiarity with Italian, which serves as a useful point of comparison throughout.

## A Living Language

One guiding principle shapes this book: Venetian is not a museum piece. While we draw on scholarly grammars and historical dictionaries, we also pay close attention to how Venetian is actually spoken today. This means incorporating examples from contemporary sources: punk rock lyrics from Rumatera, proverbs collected on Instagram, comedy sketches from YouTube. The language lives in the mouths of its speakers, not just in the pages of Boerio's 1856 dictionary.

This is not to dismiss the scholarly tradition. Silvano Belloni's *Grammatica Veneta* remains the most comprehensive modern treatment of Venetian grammar and serves as our primary reference for grammatical descriptions. Giuseppe Boerio's historical dictionary is invaluable for etymology and for words that have fallen out of everyday use. But a grammar focused only on literary or historical Venetian would miss the vitality of the language as it exists now.

## Terraferma Focus

Venetian encompasses several regional varieties: the urban dialect of Venice proper (*Veneziano*), the speech of Padua (*Padovano*), Treviso (*Trevigiano*), Vicenza (*Vicentino*), Verona (*Veronese*), and other areas. This grammar primarily follows the conventions of central Venetian, particularly the Padovano-Vicentino variety that covers the most populous and extensive territory of the region.

This choice is partly practical: central Venetian is what you are most likely to encounter, and it is well documented. But it also reflects where most Venetian speakers actually live: not in the tourist-filled streets of Venice, but in the towns and cities of the *terraferma*, the mainland.

Where significant variations exist between regional varieties, we note them.

## On Orthography

Venetian has no single official orthography. The conventions used here follow those established by linguaveneta.net, the Veneto Regional Government's language portal, which are widely used in contemporary Venetian writing. The most distinctive conventions are:

- **ł** for the "evanescent L," a velarized sound that distinguishes Venetian from Italian
- **x** for the voiced /z/ sound (as in *xe*, "is")
- No double consonants, reflecting Venetian pronunciation

These conventions are explained in detail in Chapter 3.

## How to Use This Book

This grammar is organized to serve both sequential reading and reference use. Part I (Phonology and Orthography) provides the foundation for pronunciation and spelling. Parts II and III cover nominal and verbal morphology. Part IV addresses syntax. Parts V and VI explore vocabulary and the living language.

Each chapter builds on previous material, but cross-references allow you to jump to topics of interest. The appendices provide quick-reference verb tables, a glossary, and full source citations.

## Sources and Attribution

Examples throughout this book are drawn from multiple sources, cited using abbreviations explained in the front matter and detailed in Appendix D. Scholarly descriptions primarily follow Belloni (BEL). Contemporary examples come from music (RUM, HM), social media (PV, VS), and YouTube (CG). Dictionary citations reference El Galepin (GAL) for modern vocabulary and Boerio (BOE) for historical terms.

Where an example comes from a specific source, it is cited. Unmarked examples represent common usage attested across multiple sources or in the author's direct experience.

## Acknowledgments

This grammar would not be possible without the work of scholars who have documented Venetian, particularly Silvano Belloni. It also owes a debt to the musicians, content creators, and social media accounts that keep Venetian alive and accessible.

Any errors are, of course, my own.
