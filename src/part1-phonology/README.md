# Part I: Phonology and Orthography

The sounds of Venetian immediately distinguish it from Italian. Where Italian has *bello*, Venetian has *beło* with its distinctive velarized L. Where Italian doubles consonants in *fatto*, Venetian simplifies to *fato*. Where Italian preserves intervocalic /v/ in *lavora*, Venetian drops it entirely: *laora*.

These are not random variations. They reflect systematic sound patterns that have developed over centuries as Venetian evolved from Latin along its own path, distinct from the Tuscan dialect that became standard Italian.

Understanding these sound patterns is essential for two reasons. First, they govern pronunciation: without them, you will sound like an Italian speaker reading Venetian words rather than speaking Venetian. Second, they help you recognize Venetian words when you encounter them. Once you know that Italian double consonants become single in Venetian, you can guess that Italian *notte* becomes Venetian *note*, that *bello* becomes *beło*, that *anno* becomes *ano*.

This section covers three interrelated topics:

**Chapter 1: The Sound System** describes the vowels and consonants of Venetian, with particular attention to sounds that differ from Italian. This includes the evanescent L (*ł*), the voiced sibilant (*x*), and distinctive vowel patterns.

**Chapter 2: Sound Changes from Italian** documents the systematic correspondences between Italian and Venetian. If you know Italian, these rules will help you predict Venetian forms. If you are learning both languages, they will help you keep them distinct.

**Chapter 3: Orthographic Conventions** explains how Venetian sounds are represented in writing. Venetian has no single official spelling system, but the conventions used here, following linguaveneta.net, are widely adopted in contemporary usage.

A note for readers without linguistic training: you do not need to master phonetic terminology to learn Venetian. The chapters that follow explain technical concepts as they arise. What matters is training your ear and mouth to produce Venetian sounds, not memorizing IPA symbols. Listen to Venetian speakers, whether in person, in music, or in videos, and these patterns will become intuitive.
