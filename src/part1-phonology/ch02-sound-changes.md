# Chapter 2: Sound Changes from Italian

If you know Italian, you already have a head start on Venetian vocabulary. Many words are cognates, related through their common Latin ancestry. But Venetian and Italian evolved differently, and understanding the systematic sound correspondences between them lets you predict Venetian forms from Italian ones you already know.

This chapter documents the major patterns. These are not random variations but regular sound changes that apply broadly across the vocabulary.

## 2.1 No Double Consonants

The most pervasive difference: where Italian has geminate (double) consonants, Venetian has single consonants. This affects hundreds of words.

| Italian | Venetian | English |
|---------|----------|---------|
| *bello* | *beło* | beautiful |
| *tutto* | *tuto* | all |
| *fatto* | *fato* | done, fact |
| *notte* | *note* | night |
| *sotto* | *soto* | under |
| *gatto* | *gato* | cat |
| *anno* | *ano* | year |
| *donna* | *dona* | woman |
| *bocca* | *boca* | mouth |
| *vacca* | *vaca* | cow |
| *palla* | *bała* | ball |
| *bello* | *beło* | beautiful |
| *cappello* | *capeło* | hat |
| *fratello* | *fradeło* | brother |
| *sorella* | *soreła* | sister |

This degemination is consistent. When you encounter a new Italian word with double consonants, you can confidently predict the Venetian form will have single consonants.

**Note:** This also affects verb forms:

| Italian | Venetian | English |
|---------|----------|---------|
| *scritto* | *scrito* | written |
| *detto* | *dito* | said |
| *letto* | *leto* | bed / read (past participle) |
| *fatto* | *fato* | done |

## 2.2 Intervocalic Voicing

Venetian tends to voice consonants that fall between vowels. The most common pattern is intervocalic /v/ dropping entirely (covered below), but other voicing occurs too:

| Italian | Venetian | Change | English |
|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| *sapere* | *saver* | p → v | to know |
| *capire* | *cavir* | p → v | to understand |
| *nipote* | *nevodo* | p → v | nephew/niece |
| *catena* | *cadena* | t → d | chain |
| *padre* | *pare* | dr → r | father |
| *madre* | *mare* | dr → r | mother |
| *vedere* | *véder* | - | to see |

## 2.3 Intervocalic V-Drop

One of the most characteristic Venetian sound changes: /v/ between vowels often disappears entirely.

| Italian | Venetian | English |
|---------|----------|---------|
| *lavora* | *laora* | works |
| *lavorare* | *laorar* | to work |
| *povero* | *poareto* | poor (person) |
| *giovane* | *xóvane* or *zóane* | young |
| *avere* | *aver* or *gaver* | to have |
| *cavallo* | *cavało* | horse |
| *tavola* | *taola* | table |
| *favore* | *faor* | favor |
| *novembre* | *novenbre* | November |

This is not universal - some words retain intervocalic v - but it is common enough to be a recognizable feature of Venetian speech. The dropped v often leaves a hiatus (two adjacent vowels) that may be bridged by a glide in casual speech.

## 2.4 L-Vocalization (The Evanescent L)

As discussed in Chapter 1, Venetian has a distinctive "evanescent L" written **ł**. This developed from Latin L (and Italian L) in certain positions, particularly:

- After a vowel and before another consonant
- Between vowels
- At the end of a syllable

| Italian | Venetian | English |
|---------|----------|---------|
| *alto* | *ałto* | tall, high |
| *altro* | *altro* or *antro* | other |
| *bello* | *beło* | beautiful |
| *quello* | *queło* | that |
| *cielo* | *siéło* | sky |
| *pelo* | *peło* | hair |
| *volo* | *volo* | flight |
| *solo* | *soło* | alone |
| *gondola* | *góndoła* | gondola |

The realization varies by region and speaker (see §1.2), but the orthographic **ł** marks positions where this sound change occurred.

**Note:** Not all L becomes ł. Word-initial L and L in certain clusters typically remain as clear /l/:

- *luna* (moon) - initial L, stays /l/
- *libro* (book) - L in cluster, stays /l/
- *plòvia* (rain) - L in cluster, stays /l/

## 2.5 Palatal Changes

Several Italian sounds have different reflexes in Venetian:

### Italian *gl* [ʎ] → Venetian *j* or *gi*

| Italian | Venetian | English |
|---------|----------|---------|
| *figlio* | *fijo* | son |
| *famiglia* | *fameja* | family |
| *meglio* | *mejo* | better |
| *foglia* | *foja* | leaf |
| *moglie* | *mujér* | wife |
| *voglio* | *vòjo* | I want |
| *aglio* | *ajo* | garlic |

### Italian *gi-* [dʒ] → Venetian *x-* [z]

Before front vowels, Italian's /dʒ/ often corresponds to Venetian's voiced sibilant /z/, written **x**:

| Italian | Venetian | English |
|---------|----------|---------|
| *giorno* | *xorno* | day |
| *gente* | *xente* | people |
| *già* | *xà* | already |
| *giocare* | *xogar* | to play |
| *giovane* | *xóvane* | young |
| *giardino* | *xardin* | garden |

This is one of the most distinctive markers of Venetian.

## 2.6 Vowel Changes

While the vowel systems are similar, some systematic differences exist:

### Loss of Italian Diphthongs

Where Italian developed rising diphthongs from Latin short e and o, Venetian typically has simple vowels:

| Italian | Venetian | Latin | English |
|---------|----------|-------|---------|
| *buono* | *bon* | BONUS | good |
| *fuoco* | *fogo* | FOCUS | fire |
| *nuovo* | *novo* | NOVUS | new |
| *uomo* | *omo* | HOMO | man |
| *viene* | *vien* | VENIT | comes |
| *piede* | *pié* | PEDEM | foot |

### Final Vowel Patterns

Italian almost always ends words in vowels. Venetian often truncates final vowels, especially after certain consonants:

| Italian | Venetian | English |
|---------|----------|---------|
| *pane* | *pan* | bread |
| *vino* | *vin* | wine |
| *bene* | *ben* | well |
| *mano* | *man* | hand |
| *cane* | *can* | dog |
| *sono* | *son* | I am / they are |

This truncation is most common after n, l, and r, though patterns vary by dialect.

## 2.7 Consonant Cluster Changes

Some Italian consonant clusters simplify or change in Venetian:

| Italian | Venetian | Change | English |
|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| *ct* | *t* | cluster simplification | |
| *otto* | *oto* | | eight |
| *fatto* | *fato* | | done |
| *pt* | *t* | cluster simplification | |
| *scritto* | *scrito* | | written |
| *nd* | *n* | (in some words) | |
| *quando* | *quando* or *cuàndo* | | when |

## 2.8 The Prefix *s-*

Venetian makes extensive use of the prefix **s-**, which can indicate:

1. **Reversal or removal** (like Italian *s-*):
   - *s-montar* (to dismount)
   - *s-vestir* (to undress)

2. **Intensive or emphatic meaning**:
   - *s-ciapar* (to grab) - cf. Italian *acchiappare*
   - *s-longar* (to stretch out)

This prefix creates the distinctive /stʃ/ cluster mentioned in Chapter 1 when it precedes *c* before a front vowel.

## 2.9 Applying the Patterns

These sound changes are productive enough that you can often derive Venetian forms from Italian:

**Example:** How would you venetianize Italian *cappello* (hat)?

1. Double consonant → single: *cappello* → *capelo*
2. Check for L-vocalization: final *-ello* → *-eło*
3. Result: *capeło*

**Example:** Italian *famiglia* (family)?

1. Double consonant → single: *famiglia* → *familia*
2. *gl* → *j*: *familia* → *fameja*
3. Result: *fameja*

**Example:** Italian *giovedì* (Thursday)?

1. Initial *gi-* → *x-*: *giovedì* → *xovedì*
2. Intervocalic *v*: may drop → *xoedì*
3. Common form: *xòbia* (actually from a different root, showing limits of prediction)

The last example shows that while these patterns are reliable guides, Venetian is a living language with its own history. Not every word follows predictable patterns, and some Venetian words have entirely different roots than their Italian translations. When in doubt, check a dictionary (GAL, BOE).

## Summary

The major sound correspondences from Italian to Venetian:

| Italian | Venetian | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Double consonants | Single | *tutto* → *tuto* |
| Intervocalic v | Often drops | *lavora* → *laora* |
| L (certain positions) | ł (evanescent) | *bello* → *beło* |
| *gl* [ʎ] | *j* | *figlio* → *fijo* |
| *gi-* [dʒ] | *x-* [z] | *giorno* → *xorno* |
| Diphthongs *uo*, *ie* | Simple vowels | *buono* → *bon* |
| Final vowels | Often truncated | *pane* → *pan* |

Mastering these correspondences accelerates vocabulary acquisition dramatically. You are not learning Venetian words from scratch; you are learning how Venetian transforms words you already know.
