# Chapter 3: Orthographic Conventions

Venetian has no single official spelling system. Over the centuries, writers have used various conventions, often borrowing from Italian orthography or inventing ad hoc solutions. This lack of standardization can be disorienting for learners encountering Venetian texts from different sources.

This chapter describes the orthographic conventions used in this book, which follow the system established by linguaveneta.net and widely adopted in contemporary Venetian writing. Understanding these conventions will help you read modern Venetian texts and write the language yourself.

## 3.1 The Alphabet

Venetian uses the Latin alphabet with the following letters:

**Standard letters:** a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, x, z

**Special letters:**

- **ł** (L with stroke) - the evanescent L
- **à, è, é, ì, ò, ó, ù** - vowels with accent marks

The letters **k**, **w**, and **y** appear only in foreign words.

## 3.2 Vowels and Accents

### Basic Vowels

| Letter | Sound | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| a | /a/ | *casa* (house) |
| e | /ɛ/ or /e/ | *bèn* (well), *véder* (to see) |
| i | /i/ | *vino* (wine) |
| o | /ɔ/ or /o/ | *òvo* (egg), *tóre* (to take) |
| u | /u/ | *duro* (hard) |

### Accent Marks

Accent marks serve two functions in Venetian: indicating stress and distinguishing vowel quality.

**Grave accent (`)** marks open vowels and/or stress:

- *è* - open e /ɛ/
- *ò* - open o /ɔ/
- *à*, *ì*, *ù* - stress only (these vowels have no open/closed distinction)

**Acute accent (´)** marks closed vowels:
- *é* - closed e /e/
- *ó* - closed o /o/

**When to write accents:**

1. **Final stressed syllables** always take an accent:
   - *perché* (why/because)
   - *parlarà* (will speak)
   - *cussì* (thus)

2. **Non-penultimate stress** should be marked to avoid ambiguity:
   - *góndoła* (gondola) - stress on first syllable
   - *càmera* (room) - stress on first syllable

3. **Distinguishing homographs:**
   - *e* (and) vs. *è* (is)
   - *da* (from) vs. *dà* (gives)

In practice, many writers mark accents inconsistently, especially in informal contexts. This book uses accents where they aid clarity.

## 3.3 Consonants

Most consonants work as in Italian. The distinctive Venetian consonants require special attention:

### The Evanescent L: ł

The letter **ł** (L with a stroke through the ascender) represents the distinctive Venetian sound described in Chapter 1. It marks positions where Latin/Italian L has weakened or vocalized.

| Written | Approximate Sound | Meaning |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| *beło* | [ˈbɛo] or [ˈbɛe̯o] | beautiful |
| *fiło* | [ˈfio] | thread |
| *góndoła* | [ˈɡoŋdoa] or [ˈɡoŋdoe̯a] | gondola |
| *capeło* | [kaˈpɛo] | hat |

**Typing ł:** On most systems, ł can be typed using:
- Unicode: U+0142
- Windows: Alt+0322
- Mac: Option+l (with some keyboard layouts)
- HTML: `&lstrok;` or `&#322;`

When ł is unavailable, some writers use **l'** or simply **l**. This book always uses **ł** for clarity.

### The Voiced Sibilant: x

The letter **x** represents the voiced sibilant /z/ (as in English "zero"), one of the most characteristic sounds of Venetian.

| Venetian | Sound | Italian Equivalent | English |
|----------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| *xe* | /ze/ | *è* | is |
| *xente* | /ˈzente/ | *gente* | people |
| *xorno* | /ˈzorno/ | *giorno* | day |
| *xogar* | /zoˈɡar/ | *giocare* | to play |

**Note:** In older texts, this sound is sometimes spelled **z** or **gi**. The **x** spelling is now standard.

### S and Z

The letter **s** represents:

- Voiceless /s/ at the beginning of words: *sałe* (salt)
- Often voiced /z/ between vowels: *casa* [ˈkaza] (house)

The letter **z** represents affricates:

- Voiceless /ts/: *forsa* [ˈfortsa] (strength) - sometimes spelled *rz*
- Voiced /dz/: *mezo* [ˈmɛdzo] (half)

The distinction between s, x, and z can be confusing. In general:

- **x** = always voiced /z/
- **s** = voiceless /s/, or voiced /z/ between vowels
- **z** = affricate /ts/ or /dz/

### C and G

These work mostly as in Italian:

| Before | C sounds like | G sounds like |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| a, o, u | /k/ (*casa*) | /g/ (*gato*) |
| e, i | /tʃ/ (*cena*) | /dʒ/ (*gente*... but see x above) |

**Important:** Where Italian has *gi-* pronounced /dʒ/, Venetian often has *x-* pronounced /z/. So Italian *giorno* becomes Venetian *xorno*, not *giorno*.

To write /k/ before e or i: use **ch** (*che*, *chi*)
To write /g/ before e or i: use **gh** (*gheto*)

### J

The letter **j** represents the palatal glide /j/ (like English "y"), often corresponding to Italian *gli*:

| Venetian | Italian | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *fijo* | *figlio* | son |
| *mejo* | *meglio* | better |
| *foja* | *foglia* | leaf |

### GN

As in Italian, **gn** represents the palatal nasal /ɲ/:
- *ogni* (every)
- *bagno* (bath)
- *magnare* (to eat)

### Double Consonants

Venetian does not have double consonants. Always write single consonants:

| Italian | Venetian |
|---------|----------|
| *bello* | *beło* |
| *tutto* | *tuto* |
| *notte* | *note* |

If you see double consonants in a Venetian text, it is either using Italian spelling conventions or represents an older orthographic tradition.

## 3.4 The Apostrophe

The apostrophe marks elision (the dropping of a vowel):

- *l'aqua* (the water) - from *la aqua*
- *l'omo* (the man) - from *el omo*
- *un'ombra* (a glass of wine) - from *una ombra*
- *co'l* (with the) - from *con el*

It also appears in the prefix **s'** before c + front vowel, marking the /stʃ/ cluster:
- *s'ciapar* (to grab)
- *s'ciao* (at your service - origin of "ciao")

## 3.5 Word Division

Venetian word division follows Italian conventions:

- Divide between consonants: *par-lar* (to speak)
- Keep consonant clusters together: *sem-pre* (always)
- Divide between vowels in hiatus: *pa-u-ra* (fear)

## 3.6 Capitalization

As in Italian:

- Sentence beginnings
- Proper nouns (names, places)
- *Not* days of the week, months, or languages (unless sentence-initial)

## 3.7 Punctuation

Venetian uses standard Italian/European punctuation:

- Period, comma, semicolon, colon
- Question mark and exclamation point
- Quotation marks: «...» (guillemets) or "..."

## 3.8 Spelling Variations You May Encounter

Different sources use different conventions. Here are common variations:

| This Book | Alternatives | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| ł | l, l', lh | Evanescent L |
| x | z, gi, j | Voiced sibilant |
| s-c | sc, s'c | /stʃ/ cluster |
| é, ó | e, o | Closed mid vowels |
| è, ò | e, o | Open mid vowels |

When reading other sources, be flexible. When writing, consistency matters more than which system you choose.

## 3.9 A Note on Historical Orthography

Older Venetian texts (Goldoni, Boerio, etc.) use different conventions, often closer to Italian spelling. You may encounter:

- **z** for what we write **x**: *zorno* for *xorno*
- Double consonants: *bello* for *beło*
- Italian-style vowels: no accent distinctions

These texts remain valuable, but their spelling should not be taken as a guide to pronunciation. The conventions in this chapter reflect how Venetian is written today.

## Summary

The key orthographic features of modern Venetian:

| Feature | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Evanescent L | ł | *beło* |
| Voiced sibilant | x | *xe* |
| Open e, o | è, ò | *bèn*, *òvo* |
| Closed e, o | é, ó | *véder*, *tóre* |
| No double consonants | single letters | *tuto*, *fato* |
| Palatal glide | j | *fijo* |
