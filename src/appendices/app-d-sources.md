## A Note on Dialectal Variation

Venetian encompasses several regional varieties: Veneziano (Venice), Padovano (Padua), Trevigiano (Treviso), Vicentino (Vicenza), Veronese (Verona), and others. This grammar primarily follows the conventions of central Venetian (Padovano-Vicentino-Polesano), which covers the most extensive and populous territory of the region, while noting significant variations where relevant.

The orthographic conventions used in this book follow those established by linguaveneta.net and commonly used in contemporary Venetian writing.
