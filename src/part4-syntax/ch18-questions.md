# Chapter 18: Questions

Venetian has a distinctive system for forming questions, involving clitic inversion and special interrogative forms. This chapter covers yes/no questions, information questions, and the question words that trigger Venetian's characteristic *che* insertion.

## 18.1 Yes/No Questions

### Intonation Only

The simplest way to form a yes/no question is with rising intonation, leaving word order unchanged:

| Statement | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| *Te magni.* | *Te magni?* (You're eating?) |
| *El vien.* | *El vien?* (He's coming?) |
| *I sa.* | *I sa?* (They know?) |

### Clitic Inversion

More commonly, Venetian inverts the clitic, moving it after the verb with a change in form:

| Statement | Inverted Question |
|-----------|-------------------|
| *Te parli.* | ***Parli-to?*** |
| *El magna.* | ***Magna-lo?*** |
| *La vien.* | ***Vien-la?*** |
| *I lavora.* | ***Lavora-li?*** |
| *Le canta.* | ***Canta-le?*** |

### Inverted Clitic Forms

| Normal Clitic | Inverted Form |
|---------------|---------------|
| *te* | *-to* |
| *el* | *-lo* |
| *la* | *-la* |
| *i* | *-li* |
| *le* | *-le* |

**Notes:**

- First person (singular and plural) has no inversion: *Magno?* (Do I eat?)
- The hyphen is sometimes omitted in writing: *Parlito?*, *Magnalo?*
- The inverted clitic attaches directly to the verb

### Examples

| Venetian | English |
|----------|---------|
| *Parli-to veneto?* | Do you speak Venetian? |
| *Magna-lo el pesse?* | Does he eat fish? |
| *Vien-la stasera?* | Is she coming tonight? |
| *Lavora-li doman?* | Are they working tomorrow? |
| *Xe-lo vero?* | Is it true? |

### With Modal Verbs

Modal verbs also invert:

| Statement | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| *Te vol.* | *Vol-to?* / *Vuto?* |
| *Te pol.* | *Pol-to?* / *Pòdito?* |
| *Te sa.* | *Sa-to?* / *Seto?* |

The contracted forms (*Vuto?*, *Seto?*) are very common in speech.

### Negative Questions

For negative questions, *no* precedes the inverted structure:

| Affirmative Question | Negative Question |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| *Parli-to?* | *No parli-to?* |
| *Magna-lo?* | *No magna-lo?* |
| *Vien-la?* | *No vien-la?* |

Examples:

- *No parli-to veneto?* (Don't you speak Venetian?)
- *No vien-la anca ela?* (Isn't she coming too?)

## 18.2 Information Questions

### Question Words

Venetian question words are similar to Italian:

| Venetian | Italian | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *cossa* / *cosa* | *cosa* | what |
| *chi* | *chi* | who |
| *dove* | *dove* | where |
| *quando* | *quando* | when |
| *come* | *come* | how |
| *parché* / *perché* | *perché* | why |
| *quanto* | *quanto* | how much |
| *qual* | *quale* | which |

### Basic Information Questions

Question word + clitic + verb:

| Venetian | English |
|----------|---------|
| *Cossa te magni?* | What are you eating? |
| *Dove el va?* | Where is he going? |
| *Quando i riva?* | When are they arriving? |
| *Come te steto?* | How are you? |
| *Parché te parli cussì?* | Why do you speak like that? |

Note that in information questions, the clitic typically stays in its normal position (before the verb) rather than inverting.

### Alternative: Inversion in Information Questions

Some speakers do invert in information questions:

| Non-inverted | Inverted |
|--------------|----------|
| *Cossa te feto?* | *Cossa feto?* |
| *Dove el va?* | *Dove va-lo?* |

Both are acceptable, with regional variation.

### Common Question Expressions

| Venetian | Italian | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *Cossa feto?* | *Cosa fai?* | What are you doing? |
| *Come steto?* | *Come stai?* | How are you? |
| *Cossa xe?* | *Cos'è?* | What is it? |
| *Dove seto?* | *Dove sei?* | Where are you? |
| *Chi xe?* | *Chi è?* | Who is it? |
| *Cossa vol dir?* | *Cosa vuol dire?* | What does it mean? |
| *Come se dise?* | *Come si dice?* | How do you say it? |

## 18.3 Complementizer *Che* Insertion

One of the most distinctive features of Venetian syntax is inserting *che* after question words and conjunctions. This pattern is absent in standard Italian.

### The Pattern

| Venetian | Standard Italian | English |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| ***quando che*** | *quando* | when |
| ***dove che*** | *dove* | where |
| ***come che*** | *come* | how |
| ***cossa che*** | *cosa* | what |
| ***parché che*** | *perché* | why |

### Evidence from Contemporary Speech

From social media (RUM collaboration, @giorgiogozzo):

> *"E **quando che** rivemo in bar"*
> (And when we arrive at the bar)

Standard Italian would say *quando arriviamo al bar*, without *che*.

### More Examples

| Venetian | Italian | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *Quando che te vien?* | *Quando vieni?* | When are you coming? |
| *Dove che te va?* | *Dove vai?* | Where are you going? |
| *Come che te fa?* | *Come fai?* | How do you do it? |
| *Varda come che i spinge!* | *Guarda come spingono!* | Look how they're pushing! |
| *No so cossa che dir.* | *Non so cosa dire.* | I don't know what to say. |

### In Relative Clauses

*Che* insertion also appears in relative clauses:

| Venetian | Italian | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *El posto dove che stago.* | *Il posto dove sto.* | The place where I live. |
| *El momento quando che el xe rivà.* | *Il momento quando è arrivato.* | The moment when he arrived. |

### In Subordinate Clauses

After conjunctions:

| Venetian | Italian | English |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *Speto fin che el riva.* | *Aspetto finché arriva.* | I wait until he arrives. |
| *Da quando che son qua...* | *Da quando sono qui...* | Since I've been here... |

### Why This Matters

*Che* insertion is one of the most reliable markers of Venetian speech. It persists even when:

- Vocabulary has shifted toward Italian
- Phonology has been Italianized
- The speaker considers themselves to be speaking Italian

If you hear someone say *quando che* instead of *quando*, you're hearing the Venetian substrate, regardless of what other features are present.

For learners, using *che* insertion will make your Venetian sound more authentic. Omitting it (following Italian patterns) marks speech as non-native or overly formal.

### Proverbs with *Che* Insertion

From the proverbs chapter:

> *Dove che te parli, cusì te son.*
> (Where you speak, that's who you are.)

The *che* after *dove* is characteristically Venetian.

## 18.4 Tag Questions

### *No?* and *Vero?*

Venetian uses *no?* or *vero?* as tag questions:

| Venetian | English |
|----------|---------|
| *Te vien, no?* | You're coming, right? |
| *Xe bon, vero?* | It's good, isn't it? |
| *El sa, no?* | He knows, doesn't he? |

### *Sì o no?*

For more emphatic confirmation:

| Venetian | English |
|----------|---------|
| *Te vien, sì o no?* | Are you coming or not? |
| *Te piase, sì o no?* | Do you like it or not? |

## 18.5 Rhetorical Questions

### With *Ma*

*Ma* at the start often signals a rhetorical question:

| Venetian | English |
|----------|---------|
| *Ma cossa disi-to?* | But what are you saying? (implying disagreement) |
| *Ma dove va-lo?* | But where's he going? (implying confusion) |

### With *Ciò*

Adding *ciò* intensifies the rhetorical force:

| Venetian | English |
|----------|---------|
| *Ma cossa vol-lo, ciò?* | What does he want, anyway? |
| *Ma parché, ciò?* | But why, man? |

## 18.6 Indirect Questions

### Introduced by *Se*

Indirect yes/no questions use *se* (if):

| Direct | Indirect |
|--------|----------|
| *Vien-lo?* | *No so **se** el vien.* |
| (Is he coming?) | (I don't know if he's coming.) |

### Introduced by Question Words

Indirect information questions use the question word, with or without *che*:

| Direct | Indirect |
|--------|----------|
| *Cossa vol-lo?* | *No so cossa (che) el vol.* |
| (What does he want?) | (I don't know what he wants.) |

| Direct | Indirect |
|--------|----------|
| *Dove va-la?* | *Dimme dove (che) la va.* |
| (Where is she going?) | (Tell me where she's going.) |

## Summary

### Question Formation

| Type | Method | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Yes/No (simple) | Rising intonation | *Te vien?* |
| Yes/No (inverted) | Clitic moves after verb | *Vien-to?* |
| Information | Question word + clitic + verb | *Cossa te feto?* |
| Tag | Add *no?* or *vero?* | *Te vien, no?* |

### Inverted Clitics

| Normal | Inverted |
|--------|----------|
| *te* | *-to* |
| *el* | *-lo* |
| *la* | *-la* |
| *i* | *-li* |
| *le* | *-le* |

### *Che* Insertion

This diagnostic feature inserts *che* after:

- Question words: *quando che*, *dove che*, *come che*
- Conjunctions: *fin che*, *da quando che*

Absent in standard Italian, present in Venetian - a reliable marker of Venetian speech.
