# Part IV: Syntax

Venetian syntax shares much with Italian, but several distinctive features set it apart. These features are often the most persistent markers of Venetian speech, appearing even when speakers have otherwise shifted toward Italian vocabulary and phonology.

The most important syntactic features covered in this section:

1. **Clitic subject pronouns** - Already covered in Chapter 7, but their interaction with sentence structure is crucial
2. **Complementizer *che* insertion** - Venetian adds *che* after question words and conjunctions where Italian uses none
3. **Preposition patterns** - *in* where Italian uses *a/al*
4. **Word order in questions** - Clitic inversion patterns

These features form what linguists call a "Venetian fingerprint" - structural markers that persist even in heavily Italianized speech. A speaker might use Italian vocabulary but still say *quando che* instead of *quando*, revealing their Venetian linguistic substrate.

Understanding these patterns will help you both produce natural-sounding Venetian and recognize Venetian features in the speech of others, even when mixed with Italian.
