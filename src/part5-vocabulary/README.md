# Part V: Vocabulary

Grammar gets you to correct sentences. Vocabulary gets you to interesting ones.

This section moves beyond grammatical structures to the words themselves: what Venetians call things, how those words came to be, and the expressive language that gives Venetian its flavor.

**Chapter 20: Core Vocabulary by Theme** organizes essential vocabulary into practical categories: food and drink, family, home, weather, work, and more. This is the vocabulary you need for daily life and basic conversation.

**Chapter 21: Etymological Highlights** explores where Venetian words come from. The language preserves fascinating traces of its history: Greek words from Byzantine contact (*piron*, fork), Germanic loans from Lombard and Austrian rule (*schei*, money), maritime terminology from centuries of Mediterranean trade. Understanding etymology helps words stick and reveals cultural history.

**Chapter 22: Expressive Language** covers the colorful side of Venetian: interjections, mild oaths, intensifiers, and the untranslatable words that capture experiences Italian can't quite name. This is the language of emotion, frustration, affection, and humor.

A note on approach: vocabulary is best learned in context. The thematic lists here provide a reference, but the real learning happens when you encounter these words in proverbs (Chapter 23), songs, and conversation. Use this section as a starting point and a reference, not as flashcard fodder.
