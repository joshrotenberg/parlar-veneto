# Chapter 23: Proverbs and Sayings

Proverbs are the distilled wisdom of a culture - observations about human nature, advice for living, and wry commentary on the human condition, all compressed into memorable phrases. Venetian proverbs (*proverbi veneti*) reveal what generations of Venetians have found important: food, wine, family, work, money, and the eternal comedy of human folly.

These sayings are also excellent language-learning material. They're memorable, often rhyming or rhythmic, and they embed vocabulary in context. Learn a proverb and you've learned not just words but a piece of cultural wisdom you can deploy in conversation.

This collection draws primarily from @proverbiveneti (PV) on Instagram, supplemented by traditional sources.

## 23.1 Food and Drink

No surprise that a culture centered on *cicchetti* and *ombre* has strong opinions about eating and drinking.

### Wine Wisdom

> ***Chi ga inventà el vin, se nol xe in Paradiso, el xe vissìn.***
> (He who invented wine, if he isn't in Paradise, he's nearby.)

A toast to wine's inventor - surely a saint.

> ***Cavei e goti no xe mai tropi.***
> (Hair and wine glasses are never enough.)

A man's two concerns: baldness and empty glasses.

> ***A la sera ciochi, a la matina bìsi.***
> (In the evening drunk, in the morning dazed.)

The natural sequence of events.

> ***Quando tuti te dise imbriago, va in leto.***
> (When everyone tells you you're drunk, go to bed.)

Sound advice, rarely followed.

> ***Dio te varda da un magnador che no beve.***
> (God save you from an eater who doesn't drink.)

Don't trust someone who eats without drinking - what are they hiding?

### Food Proverbs

> ***El cafè xe bon con tre S: sentà, scotà, scrocà.***
> (Coffee is good with three S's: sitting, scalding, scrounged.)

The ideal coffee: enjoyed seated, hot, and paid for by someone else.

> ***Chi va in leto senza sena tuta la note se remena.***
> (Who goes to bed without supper tosses all night.)

Don't skip dinner.

> ***La menestra riscaldà no la xe mai bona.***
> (Reheated soup is never good.)

On the surface, culinary advice. Actually about rekindled relationships - they never work out.

> ***Polenta e formai, ma a caxa soa.***
> (Polenta and cheese, but at your own home.)

Simple pleasures belong at home. Also: mind your own business.

> ***Le fritole le xe come le done: se no le xe tonde e un fià grase, no le xe bone.***
> (Fritters are like women: if they're not round and a bit fat, they're no good.)

Traditional beauty standards, carnival-fritter style.

> ***A la luna de setenbre, la ua e el figo pende.***
> (With September's moon, the grape and fig hang ready.)

Agricultural wisdom marking harvest time.

### The Pleasures of Life

> ***Magna e bevi che la vita xe un lampo.***
> (Eat and drink because life is lightning.)

Carpe diem, Venetian style.

> ***Dona bea e vin bon xe i primi che te assa in abandon.***
> (Beautiful women and good wine are the first to leave you unsteady.)

The finest pleasures are also the most destabilizing.

## 23.2 Family and Relationships

Venetian proverbs are clear-eyed about family - affectionate but unsentimental.

### On Relatives

> ***Megio un amigo che sento parenti.***
> (Better one friend than a hundred relatives.)

Friends are chosen; relatives are not.

> ***I parenti, mal de denti.***
> (Relatives: toothache.)

Family causes pain. The rhyme makes it memorable.

> ***Tre fradei, tre castei - se no, tre cortei.***
> (Three brothers, three castles - otherwise, three knives.)

Divide the inheritance fairly, or expect violence.

### On Marriage and Love

> ***Amor sensa barufa fa la muffa.***
> (Love without fighting gets moldy.)

A little conflict keeps relationships fresh.

> ***Na casa sensa dona xe na lanterna sensa lume.***
> (A house without a woman is a lamp without light.)

Traditional, but genuinely appreciative.

> ***Chi ciapa mujér, ciapa guai.***
> (Who takes a wife, takes trouble.)

The bachelor's warning.

### On Children

> ***Quando el pare fa carneval, i fioi fa quaresema.***
> (When the father celebrates Carnival, the children observe Lent.)

A father who spends freely leaves his children with nothing.

> ***Beati i ultimi se i primi ga creansa.***
> (Blessed are the last if the first have good manners.)

Good upbringing in the first generation benefits those who come after.

## 23.3 Human Nature

Venetians have been observing human folly for a thousand years of trade and politics.

### On Honesty and Deception

> ***Al busiaro no se ghe crede gnanca co'l dise la verità.***
> (The liar isn't believed even when he tells the truth.)

The cost of a bad reputation.

> ***Chi tase aconsente.***
> (Who is silent consents.)

Silence is agreement.

> ***Parlar sensa pensar xe come sparar sensa mirar.***
> (Speaking without thinking is like shooting without aiming.)

Think before you speak.

### On Wisdom and Foolishness

> ***Beato quelo che impara a spese dei altri.***
> (Blessed is he who learns at others' expense.)

Learn from others' mistakes - it's cheaper.

> ***L'ignoransa xe la mare de la miseria e de la cativeria.***
> (Ignorance is the mother of misery and malice.)

Knowledge prevents suffering and wrongdoing.

> ***Chi nassé tondo no more quadro.***
> (Who's born round doesn't die square.)

People don't fundamentally change.

> ***El mona el xe sempre el mona.***
> (The fool is always the fool.)

Related: idiots remain idiots.

### On Appearances

> ***L'abito no fa el monaco, ma el ghe someja.***
> (The habit doesn't make the monk, but it resembles one.)

Clothes don't make the man - but they do create impressions.

> ***No xe tuto oro quel che luse.***
> (Not all that glitters is gold.)

Universal wisdom, Venetian edition.

## 23.4 Work and Money

A trading republic develops strong opinions about commerce.

### On Effort

> ***Dai e dai, la barca ariva ai pai.***
> (Row and row, the boat reaches the poles.)

Persistence pays off. The *pai* (poles) are the mooring posts in the lagoon.

> ***Chi no laora, no magna.***
> (Who doesn't work, doesn't eat.)

No freeloaders.

> ***Chi va piano, va san e va lontan.***
> (Who goes slowly, goes healthy and goes far.)

Slow and steady. Also rendered as *Chi va piano va sano e va lontano*.

### On Money

> ***A morir e a pagar se fa sempre in tempo.***
> (There's always time for dying and paying.)

No rush to do either.

> ***I schei no fa la felicità, ma i aiuta.***
> (Money doesn't make happiness, but it helps.)

Pragmatic.

> ***Chi paga prima, magna mal.***
> (Who pays first, eats badly.)

Don't pay in advance.

### On Caution

> ***Fida xe bon, ma no fidar xe meio.***
> (Trust is good, but not trusting is better.)

Verify everything.

> ***Chi ga da dar, ga da aver.***
> (Who has to give, has to have.)

You can't give what you don't have.

## 23.5 Venice and the Veneto

Some proverbs celebrate the city and region themselves.

> ***Chi vol vedar Venexia vera, de istà a la matina, de inverno a la sera.***
> (Who wants to see true Venice: in summer in the morning, in winter in the evening.)

The best times to experience the city, avoiding tourist crowds and harsh light.

> ***Venexia xe bea, fabricà sul mar; chi no la pol vedar, no la pol stimar.***
> (Venice is beautiful, built on the sea; who cannot see it, cannot appreciate it.)

You have to experience it.

> ***Veneziani, gran signori; Padovani, gran dotori; Visentini, magna gati; Veronesi, tuti mati.***
> (Venetians, great lords; Paduans, great doctors; Vicentines, cat-eaters; Veronese, all crazy.)

Regional stereotypes in rhyme. Every area gets a label.

## 23.6 Weather and Seasons

Agricultural and maritime life made weather observation essential.

> ***Rosso de sera, bel tempo se spera; rosso de matina, l'acqua se avicina.***
> (Red at night, good weather hoped for; red in morning, water approaches.)

The classic red-sky proverb.

> ***Se piove par Santa Bibiana, piove quaranta dì e na setimana.***
> (If it rains on Saint Bibiana's day, it rains forty days and a week.)

December 2nd predicts the winter.

> ***Marzo passo, ogni mato va descalso.***
> (March madness: every fool goes barefoot.)

Don't be fooled by early spring warmth.

## 23.7 Proverbial Structures

Venetian proverbs often follow patterns:
