# Chapter 24: Contemporary Venetian

Venetian is not a museum piece. It lives in punk rock lyrics, Instagram comments, comedy sketches, and the spontaneous debates that erupt when a dolphin swims into the Grand Canal. This chapter explores how Venetian functions today - who uses it, where, and why.

## 24.1 Terraferma vs. Centro Storico

To understand contemporary Venetian, you need to understand the geography of the Comune di Venezia. The municipality encompasses both the famous island *centro storico* - the Venice of postcards and tourists - and the *terraferma*, the mainland including Mestre, Marghera, Carpenedo, Favaro Veneto, Zelarino, Chirignago, and Campalto.

The numbers tell the story:

- Centro storico population: ~50,000 (down from 175,000 post-WWII)
- Mestre and terraferma: ~180,000

This is where "regular people" live - where hospitals, shopping centers, and affordable housing exist. And this is where you find the most vibrant contemporary Venetian: the working-class Veneto of traffic circles, industrial zones, and neighborhood bars rather than tourist Venice.

The distinction matters linguistically. When Rumatera sings about *laorar* (working), *schei* (money), and going *al bar*, they're singing from the terraferma perspective - the Veneto that doesn't appear on postcards but sustains the regional identity.

## 24.2 Music: Rumatera and the Venetian Punk Scene

Rumatera is a punk rock band from the Venice province whose lyrics provide a rich source of contemporary Venetian. Their music documents colloquial usage, code-switching patterns, and working-class vocabulary that rarely appears in formal grammars.

### Linguistic Features in Their Lyrics

Analysis of songs like "Made in Veneto," "Na Seen," "Al Bar," and "Na scusa pa bevare" reveals consistent grammatical patterns:

| Feature | Example | Analysis |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Subject clitics | *me svejo*, *te ghe capio* | Mandatory clitics for 1st/2nd/3rd person |
| *Miga* negation | *no ghe xe miga* | Emphatic negation particle (cf. French *mie*) |
| Doubled conjunctions | *quando che* | Complementizer insertion after temporal conjunctions |
| Vowel shifts | *istà* (estate) | Systematic changes from Italian cognates |
| L-vocalization | *fradel* → *fradeo* | Final /l/ vocalizes or disappears |

### Vocabulary Domains

Their songs document several thematic areas rarely covered in textbooks:

**Bar culture:**

- *spriss* - the Venetian pronunciation of spritz (note /ts/ → /s/)
- *ombra de vin* - glass of wine
- *goti* - glasses
- *prosechin* - diminutive of prosecco
- *marzemin* - Marzemino wine
- *graspa* - grappa
- *rosolio* - sweet liqueur

**Social terms:**

- *tosi/tosa* - guys/girl
- *fradel* - brother, also used as "bro" among friends
- *compare* - buddy, pal

**Rural and working life:**

- *formenton* - cornfield
- *bagoina* - walking stick
- *trionfetti* - a traditional card game
- *schei* - money
- *laorar* - to work

**Emotional states:**

- *sidià* - annoyed, fed up
- *inbriago* - drunk
- *strassa* - exhausted

### Cross-Regional Collaborations

Rumatera's collaboration with RFC (Ritieniti Fortemente Coinvolto), a 22-year veteran ska-punk band from Caserta, produced "Festa" - RFC's first use of dialect. The song creates a Campanian-Venetian linguistic mix, demonstrating cross-regional solidarity through shared working-class punk identity. This kind of dialect pride transcends the traditional north/south Italian divide.

Their collaboration with Herman Medrano on "Na scusa pa bevare" (An excuse to drink) similarly showcases Venetian bar vocabulary in a contemporary musical context.

## 24.3 Social Media: Venetian in the Wild

Perhaps the most revealing evidence of Venetian vitality comes from social media, where people write spontaneously in their native variety without the self-consciousness of formal settings.

### The Nane/Mimmo Dolphin Debate

In 2021, a dolphin appeared in Venice's canals, sparking a social media debate about proper naming. Local Venetians strongly advocated for "Nane" - a traditional Venetian name (the Venetian form of Giovanni/Gianni) - while rejecting "Mimmo" as inappropriately southern Italian.

The exchange provided excellent authentic material:

**Reflexive verbs and clitics in natural context:**
> *El se ciama Nane, no Mimmo!*
> (He's called Nane, not Mimmo!)

**Negation patterns using *no* instead of *non*:**
> *No xe un delfin del sud!*
> (He's not a southern dolphin!)

**Code-switching between Venetian and Italian:**
Comments would often start in Italian for broader reach, then switch to Venetian for emphasis or authenticity.

The linguistic significance: younger people spontaneously writing (not just speaking) in Venetian demonstrates active language vitality. And the rejection of "Mimmo" shows how language choice reinforces cultural identity - the name debate was really about who gets to claim the dolphin as "one of us."

### Instagram Accounts as Language Resources

Several accounts actively document and promote contemporary Venetian:

**@proverbiveneti** - Daily proverbs with Italian translations, building a searchable archive of traditional expressions.

**@venetosegreto** - Features "words that should enter Italian," including culturally-rich terms like:

- *freschin* - that specific musty smell of damp, unventilated spaces
- *ombra de vin* - not just "glass of wine" but the entire cultural ritual surrounding it
- *punciotto* - traditional Venetian snack, the cicchetti culture staple

**@padovastories** - Regional news including economic data that contextualizes Venetian identity. Their coverage of Veneto's dominance in Italy's DOP/IGP protected designation economy (leading nationally at 4.936 billion euros, with Treviso province ranking first at 2.258 billion) reinforces expressions of regional pride like *chi semo* (who we are).

### Commercial Venetian: 500in510

The brand 500in510 and Rumatera's merchandise demonstrate Venetian in commercial contexts. Examples include:

- *Nadae* for Natale (Christmas) - showing the -tale → -dae sound change
- *atensione* for attenzione - showing /ts/ → /s/ simplification

These aren't errors but deliberate Venetian spellings, marketed to speakers who recognize and identify with the phonological patterns.

## 24.4 Comedy and Entertainment

### Carlo e Giorgio

This comedy duo (24,000+ YouTube subscribers) produces "Lezioni di Veneziano" and other content featuring natural Venetian dialogue. Their sketches provide:

- Clitic usage in natural speech
- Contemporary slang and expressions
- Generational differences in language use
- Metalinguistic humor about Venetian vs. Italian

Their reference points often overlap with Rumatera's - the same bars, the same cultural touchstones, the same terraferma sensibility.

### Canal il Canal

A popular Venetian YouTuber connected to the broader creator community. The cross-references between creators - Carlo e Giorgio mentioning Rumatera, shared cultural references, collaborative projects - reveal an interconnected entertainment ecosystem all drawing from the same well of working-class terraferma identity.

### Harry Potter in Veneto

Dubbed comedy videos rendering Harry Potter in Venetian have garnered over a million views, demonstrating appetite for Venetian-language entertainment and the language's adaptability to modern contexts. The humor works because viewers recognize both the source material and the linguistic transformation.

## 24.5 Code-Switching Patterns

Contemporary Venetian speakers rarely use Venetian in isolation. More common is code-switching - alternating between Venetian and Italian within conversations, sentences, or even phrases.

### Common Patterns

**Starting Italian, ending Venetian:**
A speaker might begin formally in Italian, then switch to Venetian for emphasis, emotion, or in-group solidarity.

**Venetian frame, Italian content:**
Technical or formal vocabulary might be borrowed from Italian while grammatical structure remains Venetian:
> *Go fato el download e dopo no el funzionava miga.*
> (I did the download and then it wasn't working at all.)

**Quotation switching:**
Reporting what someone said in the language they used it:
> *E lu el me ga dito, "Ma cosa stai facendo?"*
> (And he said to me, "But what are you doing?" - Italian quote in Venetian frame)

### Triggers for Code-Switching

Speakers often switch to Venetian for:

- Emotional intensity (*Ostia!*, *Porco can!*)
- In-group solidarity (addressing fellow Venetians)
- Humor and irony
- Quoting traditional sayings
- Establishing authenticity or local credibility

They may switch to Italian for:

- Formal contexts
- Addressing non-Venetians
- Technical vocabulary
- Written communication (though this is changing with social media)

## 24.6 Regional Variation Today

While this grammar focuses on central Venetian, contemporary usage shows continued regional variation:

| Feature | Venice | Padua-Vicenza | Treviso-Belluno |
|---------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| 2sg clitic | *ti* | *te* | *te/tu* |
| 3sg m. clitic | *el* | *el* | *el/al* |
| "We go" | *ndemo* | *ndemo/andemo* | *andemo* |

Despite these variations, mutual intelligibility is high, and speakers across the Veneto understand each other. Social media may be accelerating a kind of leveling, as written Venetian creates a visible standard that influences speakers across subregions.

## 24.7 Venetian and Italian: A Comparison with Triestino

The relationship between Venetian and Italian differs from that of other regional varieties. A brief comparison with Triestino is instructive.

Triestino is sometimes called a *dialetto veneto coloniale* - a colonial Venetian dialect that replaced the original *tergestino* when Trieste became a major Habsburg commercial port. It shares much with mainland Venetian but has distinct features:

- Different vowel elision patterns
- Characteristic confusion of congiuntivo/condizionale
- Heavy German and Slavic influence on vocabulary

The comparison highlights how Venetian varieties evolved differently based on political and economic history, while maintaining core grammatical structures like the subject clitic system.

## 24.8 Language Attitudes and Identity

Contemporary Venetian exists in a complex sociolinguistic space:

**Pride and identity:** For many speakers, Venetian marks authentic regional identity, working-class solidarity, and cultural continuity. The language choice is a statement.

**Stigma and register:** Venetian can still carry associations with lower education or rural origins, particularly in formal contexts. Speakers often code-switch strategically.

**Revival and documentation:** Growing interest in regional languages across Europe has brought new attention to Venetian. Social media accounts, music scenes, and entertainment creators are documenting and promoting the language in ways that formal institutions have not.

**Generational patterns:** Older speakers may use Venetian more consistently; younger speakers may use it more self-consciously, as a chosen identity marker rather than a default.

## Summary

Contemporary Venetian lives in:

- **Music:** Rumatera, Herman Medrano, and the punk/ska scene document working-class vocabulary and authentic usage
- **Social media:** Spontaneous writing on Instagram and other platforms shows language vitality and code-switching patterns
- **Comedy:** Carlo e Giorgio, Canal il Canal, and dubbed content bring Venetian to entertainment
- **Commerce:** Brands like 500in510 use Venetian spellings as identity markers
- **Daily life:** The bar, the card game, the neighborhood - terraferma culture sustains the language

The dolphin got named Nane. That tells you everything about where the language lives.
